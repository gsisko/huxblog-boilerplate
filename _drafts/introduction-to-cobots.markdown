## The Need for Cobotics

Traditionally, Industrial Robots have been used to automate tasks that are to complicated, to repetitive, or too dangerous for humans to accomplish manually. In order to accomplish these tasks, the power output and payload forces of an industrial Robot are often beyond what is safe for humans to interact with.

In the deployment of these industrial robots, it is required to take various safety precautions to ensure that human operators will not come into contact with the Robots During operation. You can see in page `iv` in the [Safety Precaution][FanucUserManual] preamble to the *Fanuc R-30iA* controller that an outline is given for safety connections and emergency stop wiring to the Robot controller. It outlines that a safety fence must be installed around the Robot arm, and gives an example diagram.

In section **1.1.1** The [manual][FanucUserManual] outlines:

>[Robot] Operators cannot work in the inside of the safety fence.
